                Events surrounded my life! I remember running around in weddings, not to mention 
                the fact that my parents have always hosted an annual St George’s Feast in our home and we 
                often had a turnaround of 200+ guests, every year. It was always fun, I enjoyed inviting
                my family, friend & strangers to celebrate the feast. I spend the lead up time preparing and 
                talking about St George and why we celebrated the feast and it’s a story that never gets old.
                And weddings, well I have been in so many, not as a guest, mostly as part of the wedding party, 
                weddings followed me into the different stages of my life. I was a flower girl a few times, 
                I dragged the dress a few other times and a bridesmaid more than I should! The Chinese would 
                call it a curse, but I call it a duty to make someone happy on a day they will always remember.

               The only thing I never liked is the camera, but I guess that’s part of the job. 
               If you are part of the bridal party, you are followed by the camera. The best 
               thing about been an events director is that you are invisible to the lens.

                I have dreamed about opening my own events and tourism business since 2006. I’ve built my connections 
                in the industry and it’s a grand, competitive one. Finally I am here and ready. I have walked the 
                layouts and designs of weddings from all walks of life. From an Australian wedding, an Asian wedding, 
                a Muslim Arab wedding, an Indian Wedding, an Egyptian wedding, an Eritrean wedding, to an East African
                wedding and I can assure you while they are all celebrate the union of two souls, it’s important to be 
                aware of the culture involve, sometimes it’s a fusion of many cultures.

                All this different type of weddings have one thing in common, confused brides who appreciated 
                the direction. Most brides have a vision of what their wedding day should look like but have 
                no idea how to get there or the cost involved in getting there, not only the dollar value but 
                the emotional and physical investment. They also don’t have the cash to spend on a planner to 
                take care of the wedding from A-z. What I have to offer is something called ‘wedding consulting’,
                which means we help you plan it, we save you time and money, you execute the plan yourself, but
                we have check-points where we ensure you are ok. We also have wedding directors who are happy
                to help you on the actual day of your wedding, because a bride can’t run the show and be the 
                show at the same time. The wedding directors look at your plan and bring it to life in the big
                day. We of course have the exclusive offer of taking care of the whole events from planning to
                executing.

                Events don’t only mean weddings and engagements, that’s why I divide them
                into three different events, there are the heart to heart events, the corporate
                and the tourism events, where people are making memories that belong to a theme 
                and Queensland.

               I have been to cities where I was hiding inside buildings working from the sunrise till the sun
                sets and I would fly back home and talk about how much I hated the city. The truth is, I didn’t 
                know the city, what I hated is residing in the same building wishing my life away. I realised 
                that bitter reality, when I decided to take a day and visit the city ‘outside’ the office.

                I saw it and it healed my heart that bled every time I landed in that city. Beside the buildings, 
                the traffic and the people who never smiled, there were people outside who smiled from ear to ear, 
                beautiful buildings that invited you to come-in and trams that roomed places I didn’t know existed. 
                Seen the city, changed my mood and transformed my perspective, I was actually motivated to work there
                and I was far from counting the hours till my next flight. I have seen it from a local’s eye.

                I always came back to claim the piece of me that I left behind. Home, Brisbane, has always been
                the most beautiful place I have ever seen, and not to be bias but even the Sun shines brighter here. 
                This city has courted many hidden tales and yet pure and uncorrupted of the commercial world it remains.
